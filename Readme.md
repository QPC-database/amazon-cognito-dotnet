# AWS Sync Manager SDK for .NET (Amazon Cognito)

[Amazon Cognito](http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) is a service that makes it easy to save user data, such as app preferences or game state, in the AWS Cloud without writing any backend code or managing any infrastructure. You can save data locally on users’ devices allowing your applications to work even when the devices are offline. You can also synchronize data across a user’s devices so that their app experience will be consistent regardless of the device they use.

If you have any questions, issues, or ideas, you can provide us feedback [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-dotnet/issues).
